FEATURES
--------

- when a thing gets added/changes/... add it to the tasks, instead of
  (currently disabled) reloading of everything

- fix search and filterByDueDate

- when typing in a new thing, when you hit @ or p: or any other special thing,
  auto-suggest as you type

- add a way to add projects or contexts on the thing edit screen;
  for example a + icon next to it

- emit events when taglists change in inbox, so that we can recalculate the
  array of selected contexts/projects for use in the filter function

- use angular-tour to:
  - explain how the app works
  - suggest things to type and click
  - walk you through the main features with about five tasks

- format due date with due in/overdue ...

- modal dialog to name current list

- see if we can use ng-repeat just to calculate the count of things for the filter in a fast enough way without limitTo

- when clicking on a list title, pass the title of the list to the things view
  until any filtering/ordering gets changed

- implement archive by reusing inbox but with completed and/or archived tasks

COSMETICS
---------

- when completing non-recurring items, gray them out, then add timeout for 5
  mins

- fix glitch with number buttons; when deselecting a number the background stays gray even when active class is gone

- fix problem with opacity of repeat password when creating new account
  - it seems some css is dynamically added that is not there in zentodone:
    [name="loginForm"] .repeat {
      -webkit-opacity: 0.5;
      opacity: 0.5;
      opacity: 0.005;
      filter: alpha(opacity=0.5);
    }
    The last two are not there in zentodone; what is generating them?
    Maybe roll back to earlier version to see?
  - For now I avoided it by removing opacity completely

- How do I override colors in bradypodion?
  app/bower_components/bradypodion/src/styles/variables/ios.less has values
  seems like I can just add them in my own app/styles/main.less, but I
  cannot find all of them

- set 'U' and 'I' letter in button to have same size with size-as-text trick

DEVELOPMENT
-----------

- add list of tests on /test (test.html is missing; check otto)

VERSIONS
--------
- angular added utc timezone formatting to time filter in 1.3.0-beta7, which
  fixes wrong due date being shown
- angular-datepicker breaks with newer angular 1.3.0-beta7 which is rc1
  https://github.com/g00fy-/angular-datepicker/issues/58

- BUG with angular-animate:
  https://github.com/chieffancypants/angular-loading-bar/issues/98

- angular-datepicker triggers a less error:
    Running "less:styles" (less) task
    >> ParseError: Unrecognised input in app/bower_components/angular-datepicker
/app/styles/mixins.less on line 558, column 3:
    >> 557
    >> 558   .core (@gridColumnWidth, @gridGutterWidth) {
    >> 559
    Warning: Error compiling app/styles/main.less Use --force to continue.

    Aborted due to warnings.

  works with a patch to mixins.less

SPEED
-----

- see if we can convert the current multiple filter approach to one where:
  - each filter input tracks which things it affects
  - when changing any filter input, we recalculate visibility of each of
    the things it affects
  - the view filter only checks this boolean on each thing
- how can we measure loading time for an ng-repeat?
- how can we measure loading time for the whole app?

ISSUES
------

- in material /test/things, clicking save triggers javascript cssclass
  jslite error; see if updating angular from 1.3.0 to newer helps
- why do a lot of things have a due date in 2015? see movies
- why is their space eaten above and below the list?
- get thing count outside of the scrolling list
- reactivate sliding effect to editing that zentodone had
- when opening a saved list with @shop, the context dropdown has the wrong
  number x of y, even if the selection is correct
- saving a list with the same name should overwrite
- should be possible to delete a list
- should be possible to show query for a list
- formalize enums using https://stijndewitt.wordpress.com/2014/01/26/enums-in-javascript/
  - scripts/services/thing.js Thing types
-make fonts offline

MATERIAL HACKING
----------------
 - bug when clicking on the taglist selector's divider
   - internals get a document and not something you can call hasAttribute on
 - no way to leave the menu open while selecting items in it for taglist selecter?
