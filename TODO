- reuse it both in the main things view as well as in the thing edit view
  for assigning projects and contexts
- add a way to add projects or contexts on the thing edit screen
- emit events when taglists change in inbox, so that we can recalculate the
  array of selected contexts/projects for use in the filter function
- use angular-tour to:
  - explain how the app works
  - suggest things to type and click
  - walk you through the main features with about five tasks
- format due date with due in/overdue ...
- when completing non-recurring items, gray them out, then add timeout for 5 mins
- fix glitch with number buttons; when deselecting a number the background stays gray even when active class is gone

- fix problem with opacity of repeat password when creating new account
  - it seems some css is dynamically added that is not there in zentodone:
    [name="loginForm"] .repeat {
      -webkit-opacity: 0.5;
      opacity: 0.5;
      opacity: 0.005;
      filter: alpha(opacity=0.5);
    }
    The last two are not there in zentodone; what is generating them?
    Maybe roll back to earlier version to see?
