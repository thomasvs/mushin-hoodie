    Lists contain things to get done.
    <br><br>
    Lists make a selection of things to get done and order them.
    <br><br>
    The selection is dynamic: the list specifies how to select things,
    and any time a thing matches that selection, it gets added to the
    list.
    <br><br>
    Here is an example of a shopping list, which contains all things
    in the 'shop' context
    <bp-action class="bp-button lists" ui-sref="inbox({query: '@shop'})">shopping list</bp-action>
  </span>
</bp-cell>

<div
  class="inboxzero"
  ng-if="!instructions">
  <div>
    <bp-action class="bp-icon fa-list-ol"></bp-action>

    <bp-action class="bp-button lists" ui-sref="inbox({query: '@shop'})">shopping list</bp-action>
